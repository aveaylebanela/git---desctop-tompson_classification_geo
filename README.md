# ATU classification & GEO

This is a project dedicated to replicating what Rinet has strifed to achieve.
We try to cross-reference motifs in Aarne-Thompson-Uther classification with their geoposition and see what opportunity for research it provides.
We do not use Berezkin's classification, as we are students of DH-course, and parsing Yuri's data has proven to be a bit over our head.
